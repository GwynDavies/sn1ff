* last, 
* lastb, and 
* lastlog

The output of these commands include: login-name, last login time, IP address, port etc


And sometimes, to keep anonymity, it is required to erase last login history.

To check the last login history, including the history of login attempts that failed, run one of the commands from the table below:

```
    Command	Logfile	Description
    last        /var/log/wtmp           Lists successful login/logout history
    lastb       /var/log/btmp           Shows the bad login attempts
    lastlog     /var/log/lastlog        Shows the most recent login

```
